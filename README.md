patient-group
=============

In order to have a clear idea of the task at hand, we outlined the following steps that take place when a patient enters the hospital:

1. Patient Identification
2. Patient record Verification
3. If patient exist, retrieve patient file else, Register new patient
4. Checks for vitals (Temperature, weight, etc...)
5. Doctor Consultation for diagnosis and prescription
6. Drugs + consultation fee payment
7. Exit

For the mean time, our objective is implementing the first three phases of a patient's visit to the hospital.
